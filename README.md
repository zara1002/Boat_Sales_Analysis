# On Line Boat Sales Analysis
A CarreerFoundry self directed project conducting an analysis of boat views for an online company to help increase website traffic.

## Project Overview:
The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.

## Goal :  
Examine the latest data to extract insights that can provide answers to crucial questions, with the goal of enhancing viewer engagement and staying abreast of market trends.
To do this I performed Exploratory Visual, Regression, Cluster and Time Series Analysis.

## Key Quetions: 
1. What factors stand out when looking atr our data?
2. What countries have the highest number of views and highest prices?
3. Are the most expensive boats that get the most views?
4. Identify correlations between features such as length, price and most viewed boats.
5. How does the year of built impact the views. What can we expect in the future?

## Data Source:
The data used for this analysis is downloaded from Kaggle meaning it is opened source and contains numerical variables such as price, width, length, and year, as well as a few categorical variables such as boat type, manufacturer, and material.
